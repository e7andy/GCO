# GCOverrides
##### [Garmin Connect Overrides](https://github.com/truxoft/GCO) - local bugfixes and enhancements of [Garmin Connect Web](https://connect.garmin.com/) 
The Chrome browser allows the user to override the look, the behaviour, and even (to certain extent) the functionality of a remote website. GCOverrides take the advantage of this Chrome feature, and try to fix some known bugs of the Garmin Connect Web application, adding also some supplementary functionality not available in the original version.

*The overrides have no ability to communicate directly with the Garmin device. They can only influence the way the data from Garmin Connect are being presented to the local user of the given Chrome instance.*

## Current Features
* **Weight - 6 Months Report** - brings back the 6 Months report plotting all weight data within the 6 motnhs period (not only monthly averages like the 12 Months report does)
* **Activity Overlays bugfix** - adds missing overlays and their labels on zoomed graphs on the Activity pages
* ... more to come

For details, please have a look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/truxoft/GCO/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt)

## Prerequisites
* **Garmin Connect account** - typically a Garmin Connect user also owns a Garmin device (usually a smart watch), though there are people using GC without owning a Garmin device, importing data from devices of other brands.
* **Chrome Browser** - you need to own a recent version of the Chrome browser, supporting the overlays (available since ~2018)

## Future Plans
There are plans for adding a number of other bugfixes and enhancements, but there is currently no schedule. Some features may be removed
in future, if the functionality of the original website no more requires the override, or when the override stops functioning due to the changes on the website.
